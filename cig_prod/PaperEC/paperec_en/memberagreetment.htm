                    is truthful and accurate, and cannot be canceled or withdrawn 
                    without a public statement; <br>
                    4. The Seller must guarantee that the commodity sample, production

                    to meet the details of the posting for buying and (or) selling; 
                    and, <br>
                    6. The Seller must agree to pay the service fee and other 
                    expenses, which the Seller is responsible for, provided in

                    in Clause 1 of this Section. <br>
                    <br>
                    5. <b>MODIFICATIONS TO RULES & SERVICE </b><br>
                    PaperEC may amend the Rules at any time by posting the amended 
                    Rules on the Site and the effective date of any such amendment 
                    will be the date on which the amended Rules is so posted on 
                    the Site. In addition, PaperEC will post notice on the Site 
                    or e-mail all Members a notice of the amended Rules. Member's 
                    continued use of the Web Site following posting of such amendment 
                    shall be deemed to be Member's acceptance of any such modification. 
                    If any Member does not agree to any such modification, Member 
                    must immediately stop using the Web Site and notify PaperEC.com 
                    in writing of their disagreement. Without limiting the generality 
                    or effect of the foregoing, we may also add, delete or modify 
                    some or all of our services at any time in our sole discretion. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6. <b>PAPEREC.COM IS ONLY A VENUE </b><br>
                    PaperEC.com acts solely as a venue for Sellers to list items 
                    (or, as appropriate, solicit offers to buy) and Buyers to 
                    bid on items. We are not involved in the actual transaction 
                    between Buyers and Sellers and are not responsible for anything 
                    that a Seller or Buyer may do. As a result, we have no control 
                    over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, 
                    the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Sellers 
                    to sell items or the ability of Buyers to buy items or anything 
                    else relating to the foregoing. We cannot ensure that a Buyer 
                    or Seller will actually complete a transaction. At no time 
                    does PaperEC.com control or take title to any item or inventory 
                    offered for auction on the web site. <br>
                    <br>
                    Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, 
                    PaperEC.com cannot and does not confirm each user's purported 
                    identity. Thus, we have established a forum to help Members 
                    evaluate with whom they are dealing. We also encourage Members 
                    to communicate directly with potential trading partners.<br>
                    <br>
                    Because PaperEC is not involved in or responsible for the 
                    actual transaction between Buyers and Sellers, in the event 
                    that either Buyers or sellers have a dispute with one or more 
                    other users, as a condition of the use of our web site, they 
                    agree to and hereby release, indemnify and hold harmless PaperEC.com 
                    (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates 
                    and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages 
                    (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known 
                    and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, 
                    arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. 
                    PaperEC do not control the information provided by other users 
                    which is made available through our system. Members may find 
                    other user's information to be offensive, defamatory, harmful, 
                    inaccurate, inappropriate or deceptive. Please use caution, 
                    common sense, and practice safe trading when using our web 
                    site. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with 
                    foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under 
                    false pretense. <br>
                    <br>
                    7.<b> MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY </b><br>
                    Each Designated Employee will choose his or her own unique 
                    User Name and alphanumeric Password through a combination 
                    of which he or she can log in the Site and the Exchange. Members 
                    are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality 
                    of their Password and account. Furthermore, each Member is 
                    entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur 
                    on their account. Each Member agrees notify PaperEC.com immediately 
                    of any unauthorized use of their account or any other breach 
                    of security. <br>
                    <br>
                    8. <b>PRIVACY </b><br>
                    In an effort to respect the privacy of all Members, PaperEC.com 
                    will not monitor, edit, or disclose any personal information 
                    about any Member or their account including its contents, 
                    without their prior permission unless PaperEC.com has a good 
                    faith belief that such action is necessary to: 1) conform 
                    to legal requirements or comply with legal process; 2) protect 
                    and defend the rights or property of PaperEC.com; 3) enforce

                    value of any Transaction (the "Transaction Fee") within thirty 
                    (30) days when the Transaction is deemed to have occurred 
                    (i.e. the date on which Seller and Buyer sign the electronic 
                    contract). Any amount not paid when due shall bear a late 
                    payment charge, until paid, at the rate of 1бы per day. 
                    The notional value does not include any applicable taxes,

                    <br>
                    10. <b>TRANSACTION PROCEDURE </b><br>
                    <b>A.</b> Initiating a Transaction on the Service. A Transaction 
                    begins with either: (i) a Seller listing Product(s) for sale 
                    on the Exchange (an "Offer to Sell"), or (ii) a Buyer entering 
                    a request for Product(s) on the Exchange (a "Request to Buy", 
                    "Requests to Buy" and "Offers to Sell" are each referred to 
                    herein as a "Posting"). The Exchange then assigns a Posting 
                    ID# to each Posting and, if appropriate, may assign a Lot 
                    I.D. for groups of Postings. Each Posting contains the principal 
                    indexes and specifications of the concerned products or services. 
                    A Posting may or may not include a price. No Posting is binding; 
                    Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, may select among the 
                    Bids or may refuse to select any Bids in its sole discretion. 
                    After the expiration of the Bidding Period, a Posting may 
                    be withdrawn if no Bid has been accepted with respect to the 
                    Posting. Members should carefully review all information included 
                    in each Posting. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>B. </b>Bids. Buyers may make a Bid on any Offer to Sell 
                    and Sellers may make a Bid on any Request to Buy using the 
                    assigned Posting I.D. or Lot I.D., as applicable. Unless otherwise 
                    stated, all Bid amounts are in Chinese RMB or U.S. Dollars, 
                    which is determined by the Seller.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>C.</b> Binding Nature of Bids. All Bids must include specific 
                    price and quantity terms. All Bids are contractually binding 
                    on the Member making the Bid until the Bid expires (as established 
                    by the Bidder when submitting the bid) or the Bid is rejected 
                    by the other party involved in the transaction; If a Posting 
                    does not include a price, no Bid is binding unless and until 
                    accepted. A Transaction shall be deemed to have occurred when 
                    both members conclude the negoation process, mutually agree 
                    on all aspects of the transaction, including by not limited 
                    to quanity and price, and notify's PaperEC.com of said agreement. 
                    Once a Transaction has occurred between the Buyer and the 
                    Seller, the Exchange removes the Posting. At the same time, 
                    the transaction result will be stored as a historical record 
                    in the data bank of PaperEC.com; and both the Buyer and the 
                    Seller will agree that this record is qualified to be presented 
                    as a kind of material evidence in case of needing. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>D. </b>Payment, Shipping & Taxes. Once a Transaction has 
                    occurred between Buyer and Seller, PaperEC.com supplies both 
                    parties information, including, but not limited to the name, 
                    address, and other contact information for each party to the 
                    other party so as to enable the parties to complete a Transaction. 
                    The two parties will perform their own duties in accordance 
                    with the system requirements of PaperEC.com in case they apply 
                    for and accept the Service. The Seller or Buyer (as agreed 
                    upon by the parties to a Transaction) is responsible for collecting 
                    and paying all applicable taxes incurred in respect of Products 
                    sold or purchased on the Exchange and all Members specifically 
                    acknowledge that PaperEC.com shall not be responsible for 
                    collecting or remitting any taxes except upon its own income. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>E. </b>Transaction Terms. If the terms and conditions agreed 
                    upon by the parties do not otherwise specify, then if the 
                    Buyer and Seller both log into PaperEC.com's Chinese language 
                    web site, the Transaction between them shall be deemed to 
                    be a domestic transaction and shall be governed by the laws 
                    of The People's Republic of China; and if either party does 
                    not log into PaperEC.com's Chinese language web site, the 
                    Transaction shall be deemed to be a international transaction 
                    governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for 
                    the International Sale of Goods. <br>
                    <br>

                    appointed to act on behalf of such Member (a "Proxy") in respect 
                    of the Services ("Proxy Services"). To request appointment 
                    of a Proxy, a Member must complete and mail a proxy request 
                    to PaperEC.com. After acceptance of a Proxy Request by PaperEC.com,

                    at any time by submitting a written request for termination 
                    to members@PaperEC.com. PaperEC.com will use commercially 
                    reasonable efforts to promptly terminate Proxy's account after 
                    receipt of the written request for termination; provided, 
                    however, that Member shall remain liable for Proxy's acts 
                    prior to deactivation of the Proxy's account. The Member agrees 
                    that all the expenses caused by Proxy Services will be for

                    act as a Member's Proxy, and may terminate such Proxy and

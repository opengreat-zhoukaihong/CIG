                    it's a traditional part of business travel industries in hongkong-macau 
                    and occident, hotel room reservations in china still belongs 
                    to the burgeoning service and mesomerism line, which has been 
                    known by more people for two and three years recently. Except 
                    four large cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, 
                    it has not developed rapidly and generally in China, but in 
                    great contrast with this, expert room reservations website 
                    or the travel website that's mainly market room and air ticket 
                    booking jumped out more than hundreds in the last year, for 
                    example, as Shenzhen to be an operation base, WWW.Cnbooking.com 
                    is one of them, but the different is that it's a seldom room 
                    reservations website with the strong supports of offline business 
                    networks.<br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>In the past one year, So 
                    many companies built room reservations website, which is strong 
                    relative to easily make hotel room reservations business run 
                    in the way of E-business. Though it's a choke point and big 
                    puzzle for E-business, the ration does not exist in the room 
                    reservations website. Some years ago, Hotel reservations need 
                    to go to the travel agency for a room living form, but at 
                    present customers booking the room by the phone or the network, 
                    can live in the hotel through telling their names in the reception 
                    desk. Though hotel reservations with E-business is the easiest 
                    operational sector in travel industries, now so for as the 
                    domestic business circumstances are concerned, there remains 
                    some conditional factors to be settled. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Payment on line is the urgent 
                    problem to be settled. It's rather easy to settle the payment 
                    problem for customer abroad only if the website open the credit 
                    card on line payment system in HK or US. Just website opening 
                    the payment system of VISA, ÕÚ ¬¥Õ, °ÀÕ , 
                    there will above eighty percent aiming customers to be covered. 
                    But at home, because of no authoritative and wide giving-card 
                    institution, with the addition of few Chinese holding credit 
                    cards, in fact payment on line is only generalized limitedly. 
                    Now Guangdong bank unite including twelve banks took a delightful 
                    step, but it's just based on Guangdong, so it still has its 
                    own limitation. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>We are difficult to hope 
                    for the international passing credit card coming out under 
                    the premise of not clearing the foreign exchange control in 
                    China. But the brand of the credit card popular all over the 
                    country is a must for the China E-business development generally. 
                    <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Room reservations on line 
                    can't settle the problem of the conversation between the customer 
                    and the operating clerk, which is another condition. Though 
                    "hotel reservations" is a relatively simple matter, but customers 
                    still have questions. For example, marked price is weekend 
                    or not? Seascape or park scene? Main building or not? Service 
                    charge, state tax included? Breakfast included and so on? 
                    Though these problems are not big, inferior by comparison, 
                    E-business is worse than phone business in this point, because 
                    by phone to book room we can settle the bidirection conversation 
                    problem. E-business in this point y need to not only settle 
                    technical problems but also settle the technology using costs.Now 
                    CNhotel booking center adopted an applied way of increasing 
                    phone business as auxiliary. The six companies we set in Bejing, 
                    Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dalian and Hongkong in fact 
                    constructed a convenient phone business network for local 
                    businessman. The indeterminacy of the room price information 
                    also conditioned the room reservations with E-business. In 
                    general, expert room reservations running mainly in "Grand 
                    China" will record 1000-1500 above three stars hotels' prices 
                    and other information. These hotels' room booking prices are 
                    not static and also not simplified. Most hotels change the 
                    contract prices only one time with the agencies monthly even 
                    quarterly. But in some areas, parts of hotels' prices change 
                    frequently especially the Hongkong hotels'. When some international 
                    exhibitions holding, there are some travel agencies fry the 
                    room price, and the prices of booking room are simply different 
                    from day to night. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>People in general think all 
                    of the room reservations agencies make contracts with the 
                    hotels directly. In fact "room reservations" exists a invisible 
                    wholesale market. For example in the room reservations business 
                    of Cnbooking.com, about forty percent businesses wholesale 
                    the same trade by network or not. There are different coming 
                    prices in a hotel. Sometimes the best price is not the contract 
                    price signed with the room reservations agencies. Then why 
                    are some hotels' prices offered by some famous travel websites 
                    in the country so high? The reason is that the coming prices 
                    of them are simple, they just using self-fixing prices. Because 
                    there are so many complex and odd prices information in the 
                    hotel room reservations lines, the management of the prices 
                    information in the website becomes very difficult. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>But in the long run, to settle 
                    the prices information's instability, room reservations websites 
                    should use self-fixing prices step by step all-around. Among 
                    them, the websites that have powerful sales will get the best 
                    contract prices, and most of the small websites will be washed 
                    out by the market for they can not get the good contract prices.

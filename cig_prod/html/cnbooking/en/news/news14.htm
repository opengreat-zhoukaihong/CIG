                    executive vice president and the general in Chinese district 
                    of China Internet Group (CIG), Yangzhenyu expressed that after 
                    the network stocks got into the low tide, the fervor of foreign 
                    capitals entering into the Chinese Internet market was really 
                    not compared with before, but the investors who had known 
                    Internet really and truly still wanted to get a thick soup 
                    from Chinese market, at the same time, CIG was continuing 
                    to look out for the right enterprises to invest.<br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>CIG was found in October 
                    in the last year. And that's business in chief was aimed at 
                    Chinese Internet initiation companies, providing "hatch machine" 
                    services. At the same time, for those foreign investors who 
                    are not familiar with the Chinese market, CIG will act as 
                    a partner of them to lead them into Chinese market together, 
                    helping foreign venture investment land softly. The head office 
                    of CIG was set in American "Silicon Valley", having branch 
                    offices in Shengzhen, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hongkong in China. 
                    It's an all-around Internet enterprise "hatch machine" in 
                    China. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>At present, CIG has invested 
                    and developed ten corporations relating to Internet, investing 
                    about two or three million dollars in total. Among these ten 
                    corporations, there are two having gotten the venture investment; 
                    in addition, some of them have gotten into the phrase of the 
                    deep negotiation with the foreign venture capitals. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Yangzhenyu pointed out, in 
                    the eyes of the foreign investors, Chinese Internet market's 
                    still the most potential market. Now network stocks are depressed, 
                    and those who have been affected are just blind investors. 
                    In fact the investors who really have good understandings 
                    of Internet will never abandon Chinese market. These investors 
                    don't want to invest no money, but for their saner considerations, 
                    requiring the enterprises could have the concrete executable 
                    payoff modes. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Yangzhenyu denoted, among 
                    the Internet enterprises CIG had chosen to invest, Websites 
                    that had no definite payoff modes or just had contents, were 
                    none. He thought, in terms of the present development of China 
                    Internet, "Mouse and Concrete" (Internet combined with the 
                    traditional business running) is still one of the best modes. 
                    <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>For example one of the members 
                    of CIG, CNHotel Booking Center is the typical mode of "Mouse 
                    and Concrete". Though at home the conditions of the transaction 
                    in the website had not formed, the information in the website 
                    had great propagandist effect, which as a result created a 
                    special phenomenon, "browse on line and transaction off line". 
                    On the one hand, CNHotel Booking Center filled in the information 
                    in the website, on the other hand, it developed the offline 
                    operating network. It had become one of the most capable sales 
                    domestic booking offices, its turnover being more than three 
                    million yuan monthly. Compared with those network companies 
                    just talking about concepts, CNHotel Booking Center with the 
                    support of concrete outstanding achievements of course will 
                    stand at an advantage in getting the venture investment. <br>

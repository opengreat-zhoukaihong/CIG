                    while everybody runs to Internet and E-commerce, CNHotel Booking 
                    Center instead invests such a large amount of money in the 
                    construction of ¡°Concrete¡±, the traditional offline 
                    companies, and the investment of each of these company amounts 
                    between RMB 200,000 to 250,000 yuan? The CEO Mr. Feng Muk 
                    Ching holds the view that it will takes 8 or even 10 years 
                    for Chinese enterprises to complete the process of entering 
                    into the Internet. <br>

                    of CNbooking.com, but it has caused the interest of many VCs 
                    (Venture Capitalists) in the conference of China Internet 
                    and Venture Capital which was attended by a number of VCs. 
                    CEO Feng Muk Ching.<br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>According to Feng Muk Ching, 
                    CNHotel Booking Center is specialized in the services of booking 
                    hotel rooms above 3-star standard in Mainland China, Hong 
                    Kong and Macao. At present, there are more than 1000 hotels 
                    listed in the directory of the Center to be booked and the 
                    monthly booking amounts to 8000 rooms. It owns 6 offline companies 
                    respectively set in top economic cities as Beijing, Shanghai, 
                    Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dalian and Hong Kong. The booking turnover 
                    of independent guests amounts to RMB 5,000,000 yuan a month, 
                    which is predicted to double in this time next year. At that 
                    time, apart from hotel booking, the profit will also come 
                    from assorted outfit services of business guests and tourists, 
                    the full set of services, such as contacting office equipments, 
                    temporary interpreter, Secretary and tour guide, and arranging 
                    entertainment. <br>

                    </b><font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>CNHotel Booking Center 
                    was established in 1997, following the practice and experiences 
                    of Hong Kong. At that time, though the domestic group tourism 
                    industry has flourished, there are only a few agencies offering 
                    hotel-booking services for businessmen and tourists, so it 
                    is inconvenient to book hotels in mainland especially when 
                    you have temporary changes in your schedule and you¡¯ll 
                    have to lodge in by non-discount rates. Because Mr. Feng Muk 
                    Ching often went to mainland on business, he found the situation 
                    and planned to fill the gap, so the first booking center was 
                    set in Guangzhou, and the second and then the third. Mr. Feng 
                    said, ¡° Our development in Guangzhou and Shenzhen market 
                    drives a number of medium and small booking agencies, and 
                    now no less than 10 booking centers in Guangzhou are following 
                    our practice.<br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>From last October, the Center 
                    began to enter into Internet to promote E-commerce, However, 
                    something strange about CNbooking.com is that it accepts booking 
                    only according to the membership, while not open to everyone 
                    like its offline companies. Why it becomes conservative in 
                    Internet? Feng told the reason that it is the demand of the 
                    Internet rule. When it is hard for Internet company to make 
                    profit, many venture capitalists can¡¯t judge based on 
                    your turnover and profit, so they can only see the hit rates 
                    and the number of members having registered in your website. 
                    So though this non-open membership method may be redundant 
                    in the business aspect, it can satisfy the venture capitalists.

                    is through Internet that the corporation got to know us¡±. 
                    In this sense, Internet is the antenna of the Center. Besides 
                    VCs, it can also get in touch with the international partners 
                    in the same business from Europe, America and Japan, thereby 
                    implement worldwide online booking serves. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Though there are many factors 
                    narrowing the development of domestic E-commerce, such as 
                    the unpopular use of credits, the limited mutual communication 
                    and something like that. However, E-commerce is bound to become 
                    the main pattern of the business transactions in the long 
                    run. At present, another main advantage of Internet shines 
                    in propaganda. Feng remarks, ¡°Through Internet, more 
                    and more people will see us and get to know us. And through 
                    Internet people can visit our website to get the hotel and 
                    rates information in our database, in this sense, the ¡°mouse¡± 
                    can produce advertising effect. </font>

                  committed to promote E-commerce this &quot;Mouse&quot;, CNbooking.com 
                  is also accelerating the construction of &quot;Concrete&quot;. 
                  the Telephone Commerce, all over the country. Now there is a 
                  popular saying that there will be no Internet companies 5 years 
                  later, because all the companies will enter into Internet then. 
                  They plan to found offline companies in 15 main domestic economic 
                  cities. Why CNHotel Booking Center invests such a large amount 
                  of money in the establishment of &quot;Concrete&quot;, the traditional 
                  offline companies, and the investment of each of these company 
                  amounts between RMB 200,000 to 250,000 yuan, while everybody 
                  runs to Internet and E-commerce? The CEO Mr. Feng Muk Ching 
                  holds the view that it will takes 8 or even 10 years for Chinese 
                  enterprises to begin the process of entering into the Internet. 
                  He also predicts that telephone commerce will still be used 
                  prior to E-commerce in the next two years in the Chinese market 
                  of tourism, hotel-booking and air-ticket booking. And two years 
                  after that online booking will parallel with telephone booking 
                  and by and by will take the place of telephone commerce. When 
                  the domestic E-commerce has developed to be very convenient 
                  and be able to realize the timely communication, then can reduce 
                  the offline companies or develop them into sheer after-sale 
                  service companies. Therefore, it is the demand of present period 
                  to expand the ground operating net, and it can also be described 
                  by Feng' words,&quot;Walking with two legs&quot;, two legs mean 
                  E-commerce and Telephone commerce. The offline net can provide 
                  potent supports for the website including the powerful negotiation 
                  ability in the hotel and aviation market and the advantage in 
                  the sale prices etc. At present, the 90% of booking orders are 
                  from Telephone commerce and 10% from E-commerce or net plus 
                  telephone. But if there is not Internet, the Telephone Commerce 
                  Part will not increase so fast. <br>
                  Though there are many factors narrowing the development of domestic 
                  E-commerce, such as the unpopular use of credits, the limited 
                  mutual communication and something like that. However, E-commerce 
                  is bound to become the main pattern of the business transactions 
                  in the long run. At present, another main advantage of Internet 
                  shines in propaganda. Feng remarks, &quot;Through Internet, 
                  more and more people will see us and get to know us. And through 
                  Internet people can visit our website to get the hotel and rates 
                  information in our database, in this sense, the &quot;mouse&quot; 
                  can produce advertising effect.&quot;<br>
                  <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Talking of the rivals, Feng 
                  said such big Corporation that possesses so many resources as 
                  International Travel Agency is the biggest threat to CNHotel 
                  Booking Center but the best advantage of CNbooking.com is the 
                  flexible operating system. ¡°We develop our business by 
                  combining the advantages of Mainland China with those of Hong 
                  Kong, and the United States. From a tiny company in 1997 to 
                  a big one of today¡¯s scale, CNHotel mainly experienced 
                  about three stages. Firstly, it started up early in Guangzhou. 
                  Secondly, it took advantages of Hong Kong this &quot;window&quot; 
                  to the outside world, so held most of the Mainland market of 
                  Hong Kong hotels wholesale. And thirdly it entered into Internet. 
                  But the past development mainly depended on its own capital 
                  accumulated through its operating. That is, after the first 
                  company gained profits the second can then be planed, and the 
                  fifth gained profits, the seventh can be planed. Next, if it 
                  can induct venture capital 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 dollars, CNHotel 
                  can have faster development and even flying development.&quot;</font></font></div></td>

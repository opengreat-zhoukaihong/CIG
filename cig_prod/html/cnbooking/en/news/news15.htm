                    many network stocks belonging to the initiation edition inflicted 
                    heavy losses not only in NASDAQ but also in Hongkong since 
                    March this year, in the late starting Chinese Mainland, Internet 
                    air was not half affected. All kinds of websites remained 
                    springing up like mushrooms. Like American, among them, traveling 
                    websites hold a large scale. Recently, a protrusive website, 
                    CNbooking.com was just one of them. It was founded by China 
                    Internet Investment Corporation whose head office is located 
                    in American "Silicon Valley", Hongkong traditional expert 
                    hotel reservation agencies, and some sales talents from domestic 
                    tourism. In the same websites in China, shareholders assembling 
                    could be rather special. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Website CEO Lanyan expressed 
                    to the reporters that since international venture investment 
                    corporations in recent months adjusted their investment directions, 
                    with the addition of many a traveling website appearing suddenly 
                    in China, at present the competition in the fields of survival 
                    and requirement of the venture investment was very intensive. 
                    Of them, "Pure Website" was in a pickle; except the few that 
                    had gotten the venture investment before March of this year, 
                    the most of them run badly. Owing to the lagging of the payment 
                    procedures and the shopping habits on line in the Chinese 
                    mainland, "Pure Website" was so hard to get the turnover that 
                    could support their daily running. But she revealed, the business 
                    of CNHotel Booking Center is running well, and it's the handful 
                    one of the reservation networks with no capital pressure before 
                    the venture investment coming out, and the reason is that's 
                    unusual operating mode. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>She explained, as long ago 
                    as the former half of this year, websites was still in construction. 
                    The decision-making classes of the three joint venture parts, 
                    China, Hongkong, United states had realized that there would 
                    be staged conditional factors if generalizing E-business roundly 
                    in China. So while building their website, they made their 
                    offline operating companies that they had have increase from 
                    two to six. But at that time, the E-business mode of "concrete 
                    and mouse" still didn't become the prevalent cognition. Up 
                    to now, CNHotel Booking center has built the offline operating 
                    networks in Hongkong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen 
                    and Dalian, six chief economic cities. When the website came 
                    out formally in July, and after having been generalized step 
                    by step, it brought considerable turnover for the offline 
                    operating companies, at the same time offline networks offered 
                    great aid for the website in the fields of the price information 
                    and customers supports. Lanyan said this kind of development 
                    mode would become their staged operating strategy, and that 
                    could be the Chinese E-business staged development strategy 
                    too. But she also pointed out as time went on, E-business 
                    in China would give off its powerful life gradually. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Lanyan denoted, the reason 
                    for hundreds of travel and business reservation networks issuing 
                    out in the former half of this year in Chinese mainland related 
                    to this line's great market potential and the bottleneck limitation 
                    without ration, but because the "pure website" itself conditions 
                    a lot, plus be hard to get enough venture investment, in about 
                    half an year, most of them would end or go in a state of half 
                    dormancy, except those who had large offline operating networks 
                    to support would have powerful lives for the profit of the 
                    offline companies was enough to make the website work well. 
                    Still and all, not only the "pure website" but also the "concrete 
                    and mouse" website, without venture investment in a large 
                    scale, would be difficult to have great development. <br>

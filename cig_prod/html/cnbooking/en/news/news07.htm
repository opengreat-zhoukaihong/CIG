                    is a business trip website offering hotel booking services 
                    mainly in the grand China area including Mainland China, Hong 
                    Kong and Macao. And it carries on the policy of &quot;walking 
                    with two legs&quot;.<br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>The two legs of CNHotel Booking 
                    Center are respectively E-commerce and Telephone-commerce. 
                    The latter refers to its extensive offline business network. 
                    Apart from a business travel website specialized in hotel 
                    booking, it also set offline companies respectively in Beijing, 
                    Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dalian and Hong Kong. While 
                    promoting E-business, take full use of telephone business 
                    as an important means of marketing. In fact, the operating 
                    strategy combining E-commerce and T-commerce is the E-commerce 
                    pattern of integrating &quot;mouse&quot; and &quot;concrete&quot; 
                    that is widely recognized in American venture capital line. 
                    Before this kind of pattern was recognized as a mainstream 
                    cognition in American Venture Capital line, CNbooking.com 
                    has extended its offline company network to offer powerful 
                    assistance for E-commerce in many aspects such as rates information, 
                    outfit services and so on. <br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>We believe, E-commerce will 
                    eventually take the place of Telephone-commerce in tourism 
                    industry by and by, however, at present and in the near future, 
                    E-commerce will still have great conditionality while telephone 
                    commerce will still have great vitality. Now there are many 
                    problems existing in the aspects of payment and mutual communication. 
                    As to the payment to foreign guests, if the website company 
                    sets agency in America and the balance account of online credit 
                    card is opened in New York, a lot of trouble will be saved, 
                    however, instead, if it is in Hong Kong, then the balance 
                    cycle, and the cost of execution and finance are too heavy. 
                    In the other hand, because of the lack of popularity of credit 
                    cards, the problem of online payment of domestic guests makes 
                    little sense.<br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>Though there is no distribution 
                    problem in the E-tourism, the problem of timely mutual communication 
                    restricts the online booking. It is the usual case that people 
                    will select carefully when they decide to take a package tour 
                    and study every tour agency no less than 15 minutes. However 
                    in detail the itinerary in the presswork is, the consumers 
                    will still have a lot of questions to ask. So before the popularization 
                    of the video system of telecommunication, we can hardly imagine 
                    online booking completely without the assistance of telephone. 
                    Because of the problems in the mutual communication, at present 
                    many businessmen and tourists choose the booking pattern of 
                    &quot;Online browsing, offline transacting&quot;.<br>
                    <font color="#FFFFFF">....</font>CNbooking.com is an expert 
                    booking website combining the traditional booking agency and 
                    American Internet investment Company. At first when the developing 
                    strategy of adopting both E-commerce and Telephone Commerce 
                    was just set down, even the American shareholders didn¡¯t 
                    understand. At that time most of the tour websites established 
                    on venture capital was extending E-commerce, but now the situation 
                    changes, some famous websites have realized the importance 
                    of telephone commerce. <br>

<FONT COLOR="#A020A0"><LI><B>1st STAGE</B></FONT> : <FONT COLOR="#A02020">Pre-requis</FONT>
<P>
- Things to check :
<P>
<UL>
<LI>First of all, do you have access to your log files ?
<LI>Do you know the path to your log files ?
<LI>Do you have cgi-bin rights ?
</UL>
<P>
If the answer is yes, then you can use this script.
<P>
- The next thing to know is the <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">PATH</FONT> to your account.
<BR>
- If you do not know what the path is, ask your ISP. It's the most basic piece
of information that you need for setting up CGI scripts.
<BR>
- Now make two directories called w3perl in your web.  Make one for your
cgi-bin and one for your root directory.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#A020A0"><LI><B>2nd STAGE</B></FONT> : <FONT COLOR="#A02020">Install the scripts</FONT>
<P>
- Next you need the w3perl.tar file. 
<A HREF="http://www.w3perl.com/download/">Download</A> and unzip this.
<BR>
- What you have here may confuse you because various files are scattered
through a number of directories, but essentially find all the .pl files in
the collection and put them into your cgi-bin's w3perl directory.
<BR>
- Here are the files that I use in my cgi-bin and I assume that if you have
them then yours will also work:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<UL>

<LI>cron-agent.pl
<LI>cron-day.pl
<LI>cron-error.pl
<LI>cron-hour.pl
<LI>cron.inc.pl
<LI>cron-month.pl
<LI>cron-pages.pl
</UL>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<UL>
<LI>cron-history.pl
<LI>cron-refer.pl
<LI>cron-session.pl
<LI>cron-url.pl
<LI>cron-w3perl.pl
<LI>cron-week.pl
</UL>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<UL>
<LI>config-unix.pl
<LI>fixerlpath.pl
<LI>install.pl
<LI>libw3perl.pl
<LI>confstat.pl
<LI>delconf.pl
<LI>init.pl
</UL>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
- Upload them in <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">ASCII</FONT> not Binary mode.
<BR>
- Set them all to <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">CHMOD 755</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#A020A0"><LI><B>3rd STAGE</B></FONT> : <FONT COLOR="#A02020">Install the resource files</FONT>
<P>
- In the w3perl directory in your root directory load in the following directories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>admin
<LI>config
<LI>docs
<LI>resources
<LI>tools
</UL>
<P>
With all their contents!
<BR>
- Set them all at <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">CHMOD 777</FONT>
<BR>
- This is something a blanket approach because you will find files that are
duplicated in different languages and some functional files that are for
people using NT servers rather than UNIX and so on.
<BR>
- But for simplicity's sake put them all in. You can rationalise once you have
everything working.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#A020A0"><LI><B>4th STAGE</B></FONT> : <FONT COLOR="#A02020">Graphic tool installation</FONT>
<P>
- If you want a Graphical display of your statistics you need a programme
called <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">FLY</FONT>
<BR>
- Ask your ISP what Operation System they are using and then go to <A HREF="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/fly/fly.html">http://www.unimelb.edu.au/fly/fly.html</A>
<BR>
- Download the <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">READY COMPILED BINARY</FONT> for that operating system. If they do not
have one for your particular operation system then you can try asking the
people there or you can get hold of the SOURCE file and give it to your ISP
and ask them to do you one.
<BR>
- If you can get hold of a <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">READY COMPILED BINARY</FONT> all you need do is download
the zipped package,
<BR>
- Unzip and ignore everything in the package apart from one file called FLY.
<BR>
- Place this in your cgi-bin and <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">CHMOD it 775</FONT>
<BR>
- Remember where you put it because you will have to fill that in during the
configuration process.
<BR>
- If you cannot get hold of a copy, the programme will still work except you
won't be able to see some nice histograms and pie charts.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#A020A0"><LI><B>5th STAGE</B></FONT> : <FONT COLOR="#A02020">Configure path</FONT>
<P>
- Now open <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">install.pl</FONT> in notepad or use the WSFTP edit function.
<BR>
- Check your <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">Perl path</FONT> is right (first line)
<BR>
- Set <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">$pathcgi</FONT> = "/www/yourpath/cgi-bin/w3perl"; and <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">$pathw3perl</FONT> = "/www/yourpath/w3perl";
<BR>
- Replace in <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">cgi-bin/w3perl</FONT>
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#A020A0"><LI><B>6th STAGE</B></FONT> : <FONT COLOR="#A02020">Build configuration file</FONT>
<P>
- Now open up your browser and go to http://your_url/w3perl/admin
<BR>
- Click on <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">Make configuration file</FONT> and follow the procedures outlined. By
filling in the details you will create a file called <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">config.pl</FONT>
<BR>
- Once created, look for this file in http://your_url/w3perl/config and move
it to the w3perl directory in your cgi_bin,
<BR>
- <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">CHMOD to 755</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#A020A0"><LI><B>7th STAGE</B></FONT> : <FONT COLOR="#A02020">Ready</FONT>
<P>
- Return to your browser. Go to admin and run <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">Customization</FONT>
<BR>
- This will set all the paths in all the files.
<BR>
- You should now be able to analyse your logs.
<BR>
- In admin go through the <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">FIRST USE</FONT> links that will start your statistics from
zero.
<BR>
- Then run the incremental statistics function every week to accumulate your
statistics.
<BR>
- In order to read them  go to http://your_url/w3perl/stats

<B> I would like to replace the logo in the w3perl homepage, how do I proceed ?</B>
<P>
<I> This image is located in $drawstat variable , the file is /resources/stats.gif, you'll need to put your image with this name in /resources/.
Take care about the width and height attributes, you may also need to
change them in cron-pages and cron-inc if your image have a different size
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="graphs">
<B>I don't have any graphs in the HTML pages. What's wrong ?</B>
<P>
<I>Something is missing....make sure you have <A HREF="need.html">fly</A> somewhere in your system. Check also the path for Fly in your <A HREF="config.html">config.pl file</A>.</I>
<P>
<B> I would like w3perl to output reports in my own language</B>
<P>
<I>
Everything is located in the /resources/lang/ directory. Copy the uk.pl to
another file to replace the second part of each line with your own words.
When everything have been done, contact me to include your work in the
next release.
</I>

<P><HR width=30%><P>


<B> Can I use w3perl with my virtual server ?</B>
<P>
<I>
Of course you can. You just need one separate configuration file for
each of your server. W3Perl will load your configuration file and save data for
each server according to your configuration choices. W3Perl need to be
installed only once.
</I>
<P>
<B> Can I install all the package in my cgi-bin ?</B>
<P>
<I>
No, part of the package need to be located in your webserver tree. This
include HTML files for documentation or graphics files. 
</I>
<P>
<B> I would like to install w3perl on my provider. What do I need ?</B>
<P>
<I>
You'll need to use the 'provider' installation. First ask your
provider if you have a cgi-bin directory (are you allowed to launch 
scripts ?), where are located the logfiles (access to data), where is Perl (is
Perl installed ?) and your server path (where your server have been installed).
</I>
<P>
<B> Your configuration file seems to be too complex for a beginner like me.</B>
<P>
<I>
Use the administration interface. If you find something unclear, ask me and
I'll add a javascript help.
</I>
<P>

<A NAME="open">
<B> W3Perl is unable to open the log file...</B>
<P>
<I>The httpd log file should be readable by users (but not writeable
of course !). Ask nicely your admistrator system to rectify this.
A 'chmod 644' on the log file is enough to run w3perl.
</I>
<P><HR width=30%><P>
<A NAME="countries">
<B>There are several text holes in the countries list. Why ?</B>
<P>
<I>There are <A HREF="http://itl5.itlnet.com/isocodes.htm">missing country codes</A> in "pays-conv" (found in the resources directory). Run the 
cron-inc.pl manually or delete the redirection output "> /dev/null 2>&1"
in the crontab, it will inform you about the missing codes. Mail me
about this and I'll fix this ASAP.
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="myhost">
<B>I don't find my hosts server in the file produced. Why ?</B>
<P>
<I>
* You should first scan your local domain ($locallog = 1). <br>
* Maybe have you put your host in the nolog option ? Remove it so. <br>
* Or maybe your host don't have a right reverse DNS table. In this case,
you should find your host in the unknow country list. <br>
* The package assume name site are no longer than 9 fields.
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="domain">
<B>I've choosen to log the domain activity but the package show no 
activity from my domain accesses.</B>
<P>
<I>
Well, two possibilities : nobody use your server from your
local domain or maybe you have made a mistake in the $localserver
variable. <A HREF="config.html">Check this.</A>
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="oneday">
<B>Cron-pages.pl stop telling me nothing will be output</B>
<P>
<I>
* Check your $tri variable. It should be "/" if you want to scan all
your log file or a subdirectory to scan only a part of your log file. Perhaps
you try to scan the logfile with a directory you don't have in your server.<br>
* Maybe you are excluding all your server from being scanned ! Check @excluderepert in
config.pl<br>
* Log file should be more than one day long to run cron-pages.pl.
Wait the next day to have a bigger logfile.<br>
* If you are using a <A HREF="multiple.html">one day long logfile</A>.
You should use w3perl in this way :<br>
<UL>
First day : at midnight, move your logfile to logfile.old and then use
 cron-pages.pl on logfile.old<br>
Day + 1 : at midnight delete logfile.old, move the current logfile to logfile.old and run
cron-inc.pl<br>
Day + 2 : same as day + 1....
</UL>
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="nofiles">
<B>No files are produced.</B>
<P>
<I>Are your directories writeable ? Have you selected one language ouput in @lang ?
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="slow">
<B>The initialisation is very slow (cron-pages.pl)</B>
<P>
<I>
Check your configuration file. Avoid to use the reverse dns option as each
lines of your logfile could take seconds to proceed ! If you have large
logfile, use a precision level lower (from 4 to 3). You can also 
<A HREF="multiple.html">compress</A> your logfile to speed up computations.
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="between">
<B> I just need to run stats between two date or I want stats about a specific day</A>.</B>
<P>
<I>
Use cron-page.pl -s &lt;date1&gt; -r &lt;date2&gt; where date1 and date2 have the following syntax : &lt;day&gt;-&lt;month&gt;-&lt;year&gt;
(day, month and year are two digits number).
<BR>
Use cron-inc.pl -j &lt;date&gt; where date have the following syntax : dd/Mmm/yyyy
dd is the day in two digits format, Mmm is the month with first letter upper and yyyy the year in
a 4 digits format.
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="fewdays">
<B> The daily graph show me only few days</A> ago but I would like to view stats deeply in the past.</B>
<P>
<I>
Use cron-day.pl with the -d flag. Specify the number of days you want to get
back in past.
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="mycountry">
<B>I would like to exclude stats from some <A HREF="#mycountry">countries</A>.</B>
<P>
<I> 
In your configuration file, your should add in the @nolog variable, the name
of the countries you want to exclude. (@nolog = ('.fr') to exclude french stats)
</I>
<P><HR width=30%><P>
<B> Does W3Perl run on Windows 2000 ?</B>
<P>
<I>
Yes. Be careful to the logfile format used as Microsoft can genere a lots
of different logfile format.

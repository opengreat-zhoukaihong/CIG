You don't have any access to a cgi-bin directory on your host but
would like to have a stats report. No problem, the scripts don't
need to be installed in the cgi-bin directory. Some features like
the administration interface are not available to you but everything
can be done by hand (only once, don't worry !). I supposed you have a
telnet access, if not go to the <A HREF="provider.html">Provider Installation</A>
section.

1.1 - Download the <A HREF="http://www.w3perl.com/download//chinaeoa/index.jsp">W3Perl package</A> on your own host. Usually put it on
your server root.
<P>
1.2 - Uncompress the package and extract all the files. It will create a
<FONT COLOR="#20A0A0"><I>/w3perl/</I></FONT> directory where all the files are stored.
<P>
1.3 - Give execution permission to the scripts (chmod +x *.pl) [Unix only]
<P>
1.4 - Edit the first line of install.pl to reflect the Perl location on your host (most use /usr/local/bin/perl). Modify also $pathcgi and $pathw3perl to the
location of your <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0"><I>/w3perl/</I></FONT> directory
<P>
1.5 - Forget the /w3perl/cgi-bin/ directory ! No use to you.
<P>
1.6 - Launch install.pl to fix the path used by the package.
<P>
1.7 - Edit the <A HREF="config.html">config.pl</A> file and customize it as your wishes.
<BR> (in /docs/conf/ you'll be able to find a example of config file for Mac, Acorn and NT, standard is an Unix one).
<P>
1.8 - Launch cron-hour.pl to check everything is right. If no error
is reported, launch the initialisation script cron-pages.pl, it could
take ages if your logfile is huge so please be patient (or use a
smaller file for primary test).
<P>
1.9 - If everything is right, edit cron-w3perl.pl, choose when 
you want to launch the different scripts and finally add it in
your crontab. If launch at command line with the -a flag, cron-w3perl 
will initialize all stats for you.

Some sysadmin don't allow you to use a crontab to launch scripts to 
avoid excessive CPU usage.
<BR> 
Best is to launch the scripts by hand, the incremental script
cron-inc.pl should be launch at least once a week but other can be
run less often. Edit the /admin/weblaunch.html file and change the URL
of the links to reflect the location of the scripts and you'll be able
to use this page to run the stats.

1 - Read carefully the documentation. Many questions are answered
in the files provided, use also the -h flag for more informations for
each script.
<P>
2 - NT users can't use cron-w3perl.pl as NT can fork processes. But the
at command can do the job for you.
<P>
3 - You can build as many configuration files you need. Just use the
-c flag to load them
<P>
4 - Don't forget numerous option are available via the -h flag
for each scripts.

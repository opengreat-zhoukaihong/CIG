<OL>
<LI><A HREF="mailto:domisse@w3perl.com">ask me</A>

Installation :
<UL>
<LI> See the <A HREF="upgrade.html">upgrade</A> file if you want to install a more recent version
<LI> Choose carefully your configuration option.
<LI> Run the package on a small logfile to verify all is right
<LI> If you run accidentally some scripts several time, don't worry, it
won't produce bad values but rather a warning message !
</UL>
<P>
Configuration :
<UL>
<LI> There are some configuration files for mac and risc-os available in /doc/conf/
<LI> if you are running virtual web servers, install the package only once, make
as much as you need config-<web>.pl files and call the scripts via the -c flag to load
them.
<LI> if you don't want to log your user, use <I>@exclurepert = ('/~');</I>
<LI> You can use regex expression, for example, if you don't want to log
users from a provider, use <I>@nolog = ('/ppp*.club-internet.fr/');</I> <BR>
(people from club-internet have an dynamic IP like ppp&lt;string&gt;.club-internet.fr
<LI> Don't use <I>@selecrepert = ('/');</I> ! It should be directories in the
same depth level
<LI> If you have a large logfile and only want to scan few days before, use option
available in cron-pages.pl. You can choose starting and ending days.
<LI> Don't forget cron-xxx.pl -h for list of available options.
<LI> If your logfile is updated only few time a day (and not in real time as
most do), the best time to run cron-inc is just before midnight.
<LI> Unix users are advised to launch cron-w3perl.pl -u to compute stats
for initialisation.

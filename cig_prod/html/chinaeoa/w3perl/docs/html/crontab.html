<P>You should have permission to execute cron commands (ask your administration system if you can't). 
You need to write the full pathname for the files to run.
<P>
cron-w3perl.pl have been introduced to avoid lots of lines
in your crontab and it will compute the scripts in the right order.
<BR>
Edit this file and give your own value for scripts day/hour timelaunch.
<BR>
You only have to add this line in your crontab :
<BR>
01 00 * * * /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/w3perl/cron-w3perl.pl -e &gt; /dev/null
<CENTER><BR>or<BR></CENTER>
01 00 * * * /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/w3perl/cron-w3perl.pl -e -c /norfolk/www/w3perl/config-oj.pl &gt; /dev/null
<BR>
if you need to load a configuration file.
<BR>
Redirection to /dev/null is used to cancel messages report.

<P>
<LI><B>NT</B>
<P>
NT users can't use cron-w3perl so they need to add one line for each script
in their scheduler event (Unix look like :)

<LI> Cron-inc will be run each night at 00:10, it should be the first
to run as it produces results files for the other programs except cron-hour.pl
<b>You should have run cron-pages.pl once before after installing the package !</b>
<LI> Cron-hour.pl is running every hour.
<LI> Others programs should be run later when cron-inc has finished its works.

<LI> Cron-url.pl will output a file for URL to document's title conversion.
You could run it every day just before cron-inc.pl. I've choose to run it
only once a week as I don't have a lots of new html pages every day !
<LI> cron-refer, cron-agent don't have to be run if you don't use a httpd which
log the referer and agent information.
<LI> Cron-session can take a while if you have very large log file.
<P>

You will receive an email on the morning telling you what's wrong if 
you've got trouble.

<B>New in version 2.40</B>, cron-w3perl.pl can be launch to run all
incremental script one by one. NT can't use cron-w3perl, sorry.
<P>
You'll need to call it via the -e flag (cron-w3perl.pl -e).
<P>
You need to launch it once a week.

<P>
Execute the program at the commands line. Use '-h' to see options available.<BR>
After having configured the config.pl script, you can run cron-pages.pl.
Wait for the process to finish and check the result.
Never use again cron-pages now, use instead cron-inc.pl, it will compute
incremental stats by scanning only the previous day.
Cron-inc is able to scan the 7 last previous day, so you don't have to run it daily
if you want. If you forget to run it for a week or more, run cron-pages or use the
-s option in cron-inc (but it will be faster to use cron-pages if you are very late).<BR>
So run :
<UL>
<LI>cron-pages for the first time or if you forget to run cron-inc for a while.
<LI>cron-inc for a daily incremental stats
</UL>
Then run :
<UL>
<LI>cron-hour to have hourly stats (each hour)
<LI>cron-day to have daily stats (once a day)
<LI>cron-week to have weekly stats (once a week)
<LI>cron-month to have monthly stats (once a month)
</UL>
Except for hourly stats, the results will be updated from the last time you ran
the scripts...you won't loose any data if you don't run the scripts every day.
<P>
If you don't see a link for the monthly or weekly stats, the reason is your logfile
doesn't contains enough data to compute them at the moment.
To have more information, you can run optionnal scripts :
<UL>
<LI>cron-agent to have agent stats
<LI>cron-refer to have referer stats
<LI>cron-url to have stats about your web pages (a map between url and name of the HTML document is also done)
<LI>cron-session to have session stats
<LI>cron-error to have error stats
</UL>
You can run them when you want ; once a week is enough for me.
You will need to wait a day for having a link from the homepage as the update is made by cron-inc.

What means Setiware ?
<BR>
When you work for a long time and produce something people like, it's
a nice idea to give the package the shareware option. But instead of
claiming money, I would rather love to get more Seti@Home units as I'm
an E.T tracker ;) So Setiware is a shareware variante. <BR> 
<A HREF="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</A> is a scientific experiment that uses Internet-connected computers 
in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). You can participate 
by running a free program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope 
blocks of data. The results of analyzed block of data are sent back when
processed and give you one credit. <BR>
The more credit you have, the more search you have done. As a Seti addicted, 
I am looking for more processing power to analyze more data.
So, few Seti@home units against the use of w3perl seems to be fair for me.
You don't have to but it would be nice of you. Just logon to their server and reduce the data using my logging account : domisse@w3perl.com... :)
 <!--
Why using a shareware package instead of a freeware one ?<BR>
Well, I've been working on W3Perl for more than 4 years as an hobby. The
software run on many servers around the world and I like to improve it.
Many commercial web stats package are selling their product in a very
expensive way. I would be happy to get some feedback (greetings, 
postcards, <A HREF="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI credits</A> ...)
or anything else for the nights spent in front of the computer.
Hopefully, I've met some nice people who
help me to work with bugged version. Now the package is nearly complete
(too many features are saying some ;), it's time to work on something else.
Developments will slow down....

The w3perl package is <B>SETIWARE</B>.<BR>
<BR>
It means you can use it as long as you want. If you like the package, you
can (but you don't have to) help me in a various ways :
<!--
If you use w3perl on a day to day basis or if you like the package, it may be nice to
<A HREF="register.html">register</A>.  You may NOT copy (except for personal use) 
or distribute the package if it has been registered.
<P>        

If you are running a commercial web, fee is $50 :
<UL>
<LI> One IP : one licence
<LI> Unlimited use : $300 (ISP)
</UL>
<P>
If you are not a commercial web :
-->
<UL>
<LI> you can help me to promote or develop the package
<LI> you send me a small fee
<LI> you can send me a postcard (except from Paris please ;)
<LI> you can compute some <A HREF="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</A> credits for me.
</UL>
<P>
If you choose one of this option, I'll be glad to hear from you as a
registered user. 
This allow you to use the latest bug fix, to receive email support, to suggest me features you would 
like to see.<BR>
If you now are using an improved version of w3perl, is especially because there
some people who encouraged me to continue its development by sending me a
registration fee or greetings.

Usually, you don't have an telnet access when you open an account
on a provider. But you have a cgi-bin directory where files you can
download have automatically execution permission. if not, you
can't install the package !

1.1 - Download the <A HREF="http://www.w3perl.com/download/index.html">W3Perl package</A> on <I><B>your own computer</B></I> and extract it into the <FONT COLOR="#A020A0">w3perl directory</FONT>. You'll have to make two packages, one for perl scripts and the other for resource files.
<P>
1.2 - Edit the install.pl script to reflect the Perl location on <I><B><FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">your
provider hosts</FONT></B></I> (most use /usr/local/bin/perl). 
Then edit $pathcgi to reflect the location where you will install the 
<FONT COLOR="#A02020">cgi scripts on your provider host</FONT>. 
Finally edit $pathw3perl to reflect the location of
your <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">stats directory</FONT> on your provider host.
<P>
1.3 - Make two tar files. 
One will contains all the perl scripts. Move the scripts inside 
<FONT COLOR="#A020A0">w3perl/cgi-bin/w3perl/*.pl</FONT> into <FONT COLOR="#A020A0">w3perl</FONT> and make a tar file (<I>tar -cvf
pack1.tar *.pl</I>).<BR>
The other will contains HTML files and
resources files located in <FONT COLOR="#A020A0">w3perl/resources/ w3perl/admin/ w3perl/docs/ w3perl/config/</FONT>. Use <I>tar -cvf pack2.tar resources/* docs/* /admin/*</I>.
<BR>
You can of course make a zip file if you can unzip files on your provider
hosts. If you can't either unzip or untar files, you'll have to send
the files one by one.
<P>
1.4 - Create in the cgi-bin provider host a subdirectory called <FONT COLOR="#A02020">w3perl</FONT>.
Also create a <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">stat directory</FONT> in your server root 
(create a <I>/w3perl/</I> directory from
your server root where w3perl will the name of your stats directory, you
could choose another directory name of course).
<P>
1.5 - Upload pack1.tar in your <FONT COLOR="#A02020">/cgi-bin/w3perl/</FONT> provider host and 
pack2.tar in <FONT COLOR="#20A0A0">/w3perl/</FONT>.
<P>
1.6 - Untar all these files (if you can't, send the files one by one !)
<P>
1.7 - Use your favourite browser and go to www.yourwebsite.com/w3perl/admin/
. You'll see the w3perl administration interface. Select first 'Customization'  in the 'W3Perl Launch' section which will update all path inside the scripts.
<P>
1.8 - Now go back and select 'Make configuration file' and fill the different forms.
You'll need to copy the current config.pl to another name or the script
will complain about an existing file. If nothing appears, something is
wrong, check your scripts are located in the /cgi-bin/w3perl/ directory and
the resources files are located in your w3perl directory. If everything
seems good, just ask me ;) (but check before)
<P>
1.9 - Now you're ready to compute your stats !
Unix user can click on 'Initialization' which will launch all scripts stats
(please be patient if your logfile is huge and/or your host slow). NT
users will have to run scripts one by one in the 'First use' section, select
first 'Documents stats', then 'Main stats' and the others.<BR>
Messages will be displayed while computing showing you the different 
part of the computation. If an error occured, check your configuration 
file or if nothing is displayed, view your error_log logfile to see what's wrong.

<P>
Some providers don't allow you to create subdirectories inside
their cgi-bin directory for 'security restriction'.
<BR> Standard installation assumed you can create subdirectories so
you'll need to change few things to install the package. (1.4 is
not possible for you).
<P>
2.1 - Before making the two tar package, edit all the files
inside /w3perl/admin/* and change /cgi-bin/w3perl/ to /cgi-bin/ in the
first few lines.

1 - Some provider use a different name for the cgi-bin name directory.
For example, Rapidsite use /cgi-local/ instead of /cgi-bin/. You'll
need to edit all the files in /w3perl/admin/ to change /cgi-bin/ to /cgi-local/ ! (see 2.1).
<P>
2 - If your provider allow you to use a crontab, choose to launch
cron-w3perl.pl once a day which will compute all incremental scripts
for you. You'll have to edit cron-w3perl.pl to choose which scripts
to launch and when. No data is lost if you run stats at least once a week.
<P>
3 - Install a password in the /w3perl/admin/ to avoid everyone to change
your stats settings.
<P>
4 - If you uncompress the package on a PC, edit files and upload then to
an Unix server, take care of carriage return character.

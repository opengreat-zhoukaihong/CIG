Installation can be done if 

A] cgi-bin and telnet

C] cgi-bin without telnet
D] NT users

INSTALL
=======


A] INSTALLATION FOR UNIX USER (cgi-bin and telnet) :
----------------------------------------------------

<webdir> is your server root directory
<w3perldir> is the location where the w3perl package have been extracted

1) Extract the package inside your web server tree

cd /<webdir>/htdocs/
tar -zxvf w3perl.tar.gz
/<webdir>/htdocs/w3perl/ will be created (<w3perldir>)


2) Edit the install.pl script and setup three variables

a) the first line is your Perl path
b) $pathcgi is the directory where the w3perl script will be placed : /<webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl
c) $pathw3perl is the directory where the w3perl package have been extracted
(the directory where you are are reading this file from) : <w3perldir>

3) Run install.pl

4) Launch web interface

Use your browser and go to /w3perl/admin/
Select 'Make configuration files' (use default 'config' for filename)
Fill the different forms..
You will have to move the configuration file you have built
from <w3perldir>/config/<configfile> to 
/<webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl/<configfile>

5) Compute stats

Run first cron-hour.pl either in telnet or from the admin interface.
(Use your browser and go to /w3perl/admin/, Select 'Launch scripts', 
Click on 'Hour stats')
If no error is reported, run cron-w3perl.pl which will compute
everything foy you.


==========================================================================

B] INSTALLATION FOR UNIX USER (no cgi-bin and telnet) :

<webdir> is your server root directory
<w3perldir> is the location where the w3perl package have been extracted

1) Extract the package inside your web server tree

cd /<webdir>/htdocs/
tar -zxvf w3perl.tar.gz
/<webdir>/htdocs/w3perl/ will be created (<w3perldir>)


2) Edit the install.pl script and setup three variables

a) the first line is your Perl path
b) $pathcgi is the directory where the w3perl script will be placed. 
As you don't have any cgi-bin directory, you should keep the current
directory as the target : <w3perldir>
c) $pathw3perl is the directory where the w3perl package have been extracted
(the directory where you are are reading this file from) : <w3perldir>

3) Run install.pl

4) Configuration files

User without cgi-bin access can't use the administration interface.
You'll have to make your configuration files by yourself.
cd <w3perldir>/config/
Inside you'll find a default configuration file for unix, edit and
modify it with your own walues.

5) Compute stats

Run first cron-hour.pl to check everything is ok.
If no error is reported, run cron-w3perl.pl which will compute
everything foy you.

==========================================================================

Basic installation need to move the scripts into your cgi-bin directory.
Then edit fixperlpath.pl and config.pl file.
Finally, launch the scripts.

C] INSTALLATION FOR UNIX USER (cgi-bin without telnet) :
--------------------------------------------------------

<webdir> is your remote server root directory
<local_w3perldir> is the location where the w3perl package have been extracted
<w3perldir> is the remote directory where the w3perl package will be installed
You'll have to use ftp to put w3perl files.

1) Extract the package on your computer

tar -zxvf w3perl.tar.gz
<local_w3perldir> will be created 

2) Install w3perl files

	a) Create a /w3perl/ subdirectory in your remote server

FTP : cd /<webdir>/www/ or whatever your www directory is.
FTP : mkdir w3perl ==> <w3perldir>

	b) Put files

FTP : cd /<webdir>/www/w3perl
FTP : put admin/*
FTP : put config/*
FTP : put docs/*
FTP : put resources/*

	c) Permission

FTP : chmod 777 config
FTP : chmod 777 resources/admin

3) Edit install.pl

a) the first line is your remote Perl path
b) $pathcgi is the remote directory where the w3perl script will be placed : 
/<webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl/
c) $pathw3perl is the remote directory where the w3perl package have been 
installed : <w3perldir>

4) Install w3perl scripts files

	a) Create a /w3perl/ subdirectory in your remote cgi-bin

FTP : cd /<webdir>/cgi-bin/
FTP : mkdir w3perl

	b) Move all the scripts in this cgi-bin subdirectory

FTP : put *.pl /<webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl/
FTP : put *.sh  /<webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl/
FTP : put  cgi-bin/w3perl/* /<webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl/

	c) Executable

Check all scripts are runnable. If not
FTP : chmod +x *.pl
FTP : chmod +x *.sh

5) Configure path

Use your browser and go to /w3perl/admin/
Select 'Launch scripts'
Click on 'Customisation'
The list of files modified will be show.

6) Launch web interface

Go back
Select 'Make configuration files' (use default 'config' for filename)
Fill the different forms..
You will have to move the configuration file you have built
from /<w3perldir>/config/<configfile> to 
/<webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl/<configfile>

--                                           --
---- If the above failed                  -----
---- Manual configuration                 -----
---- (but best is to use admin interface) -----
--                                           --

Example available in <local_w3perldir>/config/config-unix.pl
You will have to move it to <webdir>/cgi-bin/w3perl
Use config.pl filename for default configuration file.


7) Compute stats

Run first cron-hour.pl from the admin interface.
(Use your browser and go to /w3perl/admin/, Select 'Launch scripts', 
Click on 'Hour stats')

==========================================================================

Advice : 

a) best is to use the admin interface to generate your configuration
file and to launch the scripts via telnet
b) First test with one small script : cron-hour.pl
c) If everything is OK, run cron-pages.pl for initialisation or
cron-w3perl.pl -a to compute everything.

D] NT users
-----------

a) Just run the w3perl.exe binary
b) Before using the administration interface, be sure that the following 
   directories are writeable by the server :
   - /w3perl/ (if you want to launch stats via the admin interface)
   - /config/
   - /resources/admin/
c) Create a configuration file and move it to the /cgi-bin/w3perl directory

==========================================================================

UPGRADE
=======

1) Make a copy of install.pl and fixperlpath.pl scripts
2) Unpack the package over the previous one
3) Restore install.pl and fixperlpath.pl scripts
4) Go to the administration interface /w3perl/admin/
5) Choose the upgrade facility
6) Copy the upgraded configuration files to your cgi-bin directory.

Configuration files directory
-----------------------------

This directory should be filled with w3perl configuration files.
The administration interface (/w3perl/admin/) will create
files inside this directory. As scripts are running by web server with
minimal permission, this directory should be read/write to everyone.
(chmod 777).

To install configuration files, you'll need to copy (NOT move) them
in your cgi-bin directory with others w3perl scripts.

If you upgrade configuration files either from the administration 
interface or by hand, you need to modify the files inside this
directory and then copy them in your cgi-bin.

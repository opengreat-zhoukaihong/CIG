                Our Use of Your Information.</b><br>
                We use personally identifiable information about you to improve 
                our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze 
                site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to 
                customize our site's content, layout, and services. We believe

                on the Site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce 
                our Member Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users

                rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users 
                using multiple User Names or aliases<br>
                <b><br>
                Our Disclosure of Your Information. </b><br>
                Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we 
                cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other 
                personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in 
                ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We will disclose 
                information about you (including but not limited to your User 
                Name, name, street address, city, state/province, zip code, country, 
                phone number, e-mail, and company) to law enforcement or other 
                government officials and third parties if we, in our sole discretion, 
                have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to be executed. 
                The following describes some of the ways that your personally 
                identifiable information may be disclosed. <br>
                <br>
                (a). We aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose 
                such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other marketing 
                and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do 
                not disclose to these entities any information that could be used 
                to personally identify you. Certain information, such as your 
                password, email address, credit card number, and bank account 
                number, are not disclosed to marketing advertisers in aggregate 
                or individually at all. <br>
                (b). Throughout the Site, you are identified by a integration 
                of your User Name and Password. Your User ID can be used to identify 
                you and your activities throughout the Site. Other people can 
                see your bids, items that you have won in the past, your member 
                rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and 
                so on. We also provide others a number of ways to allow other 
                users to find more out about you and your site activities, such 
                as our feature that allows users to quickly see all of the prices 
                you are offering at the time. <br>
                (c). PaperEC.com offers a number of third party services from 
                our site. If you choose to use these optional services, we will, 
                by necessity, provide some of your personally identifiable information 
                to the Co-Brand Service Provider offering such services. Because 
                we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, 
                you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their 
                services. <br>
                (d). Legal Requests. PaperEC.com cooperates with law enforcement 
                inquires and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual 
                property and other rights. <br>
                (e). Suppliers and Other Service Providers. We may use third party 
                Suppliers and Service Providers to facilitate our services. For 
                example, we may outsource the operations of one or more aspects 
                of our site to a Supplier or Service Provider who performs services 
                according to our requirements. In some instances, the Service 
                Provider may collect information directly from you (such as the 
                situation where we ask a Service Provider to conduct a survey 
                for us). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement 
                of the Supplier or Service Provider, and all information disclosures 
                you make will be strictly optional. In all cases, we restrict 
                how these Suppliers and Other Service Providers may access, use 
                and disclose your information. In general, we do not permit these 
                Suppliers and Other Service Providers to sell your information 
                to third parties. <br>
                (f). Public Information Area. This site makes forums, BBS for 
                Jobs and Equipment, message boards, and/or news groups available 
                to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed 
                in these areas becomes public information. <br>

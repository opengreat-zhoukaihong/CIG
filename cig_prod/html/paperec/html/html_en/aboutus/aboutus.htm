          <td height="74" class="d1" width="100%"> Founded in April 2000, PaperEC.com 
            is a vertical <b>B2B</b> full solution provider for China's pulp and 
            paper industry, and provides a true marketplace for the online transaction 
            of pulp and paper products. Overseas experts with long Internet and 
            management history, as well as domestic paper organizations and scholars 
            founded the company. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Industry Background <br>
            </b>The paper industry is one of the basic industries of every national 
            economy. It is closely connected with society, the economy and people's 
            lives. The pulp and paper industry is also closely related to news, 
            press, printing, packing and forestry. The consumption of paper products 
            in China has increased greatly in recent times. For instance, Chinese 
            domestic consumption of paper and paper products in 1999 was 33.47 
            million tons, representing a value of USD 32 billion, of which, nearly 
            USD 6 billion were imported paper products.<br>
            <br>
            The Chinese pulp and paper market comprises approximately 75,000 companies; 
            of which approximately half are paper producers and the other half 
            use paper as a raw material. Of China's paper producers, nearly 98% 
            are small-scale companies and are scattered throughout the country. 
            Small-scale paper product producers in China, when compared to the 
            larger enterprises, are at a distinct disadvantage with regard to 
            expanding market share, conducting international trade, and improving 
            operation efficiency. PaperEC.com will level the playing field.<br>
            <br>
            Further, the pulp and paper industry is well situated to adopt e-Commerce. 
            Two major factors contribute to this. One, paper is a standardized 
            product that can be accurately described through product specifications. 
            Two, the pulp and paper industry is a global industry and people in 
            the industry are used to conducting transaction with other parties 
            in remote locations.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Business Model <br>
            </b>PaperEC.com is a professional <b>B2B</b> web site providing e-commerce 
            for the online transaction of paper products. Through the trading 
            floor, PaperEC.com enables both buyers and sellers to negotiate prices 
            and make deals easily and directly.<br>
            <br>
            <b>(1) Posting and Negotiation </b><br>
            Sellers can post product offers on the web site and make these available 
            to one, a list of their choice, or to all buyers. The same is true 
            of buyers, they can post product inquires and send these to one, a 
            list of choice, or to all sellers. Buyers can then respond to the 
            offers and begin negotiations. Each supplier can respond to the inquiry 
            by stating his conditions and price, and then the buyer can negotiate 
            with one or several suppliers at once. The negotiation is carried 
            out anonymously.<br>
            <br>
            <b>(2) Transaction Manager</b><br>
            The participants are in complete control of their information and 
            choose what information they want to share with others, with the result 
            that competitors will never be able to access each other's information. 
            Participants are also fully in charge of how they sell their products 
            (fixed price, negotiation or auction) and with whom they make deals 
            (one player, a list of players or all). Each transaction is on an 
            individual to individual basis.<br>
            <br>
            <b>(3) Transaction Conclusion </b><br>
            When both sides reach an agreement through their negotiations, the 
            seller submits a transaction application to PaperEC.com and signs 
            an electronic contract. The web site signs the contract and sends 
            it to the buyer for his signature. With all three parties' signatures, 
            the electronic contract becomes valid and the transaction is successful. 
            <br>
